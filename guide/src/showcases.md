**TODO:** A collection of work made with nannou, perhaps ordered from most
recent to the past. Users could do a PR to have their own nannou projects
published.

## software projects
* [rusty-vision](https://github.com/julesyoungberg/rusty-vision) A live GLSL coding environment built with Rust, Nannou, and wgpu
* [Oscen ("oh-sin")](https://github.com/reedrosenbluth/oscen) is a library for building modular synthesizers in Rust
* [microwave](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/tree/master/microwave) is a microtonal modular waveform synthesizer with soundfont rendering capabilities
* [waveform](https://github.com/julesyoungberg/waveform) - basic audio visualizer in rust with nannou.
* [Talking Windows](https://github.com/eulervoid/window-talk) - a generative animation with talking windows and an desperate mouse pointer trying to close them.
