# Getting Started

If you are new to nannou or Rust, you are in the right place!

In this section, we will:

1. Install the Rust programming language.
2. Check for platform-specific requirements.
3. Setup our code editor for working with Rust.
4. Run some nannou examples.
5. Make our own, new nannou project!

People with prior experience using other creative coding frameworks
will also find help transitioning.

Let's get started.
